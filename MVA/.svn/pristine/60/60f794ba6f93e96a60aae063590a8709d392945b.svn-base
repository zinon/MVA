BDT training directory.
Setup root 5.34 with: source setup_root.sh

and now add source setup_gui.sh


Old (basic): To run the training do:
 root -l TMVAClassificationHadHad.C\(\"BDT\"\) 
This should be run twice, once with the flag EO_Flag set to 0 and once with it set to 1.


Now:  root -l RunTMVAClassificationHadHad4.C\(\"BDT\"\)
This should be run with "PartUsedForTraining = " set to A and then again set to B in TMVAClassificationHadHad4.C

This will run on half of the events at a time.

The files 
TMVAClassificationHadHad_XX_BDT.weights.xml
TMVAClassificationHadHad_XX_BDT.weights.xml

will be produced in the weights directory.

The next step is to apply the weights to the data and all the
signal and background files.
